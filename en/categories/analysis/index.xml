      <description>&lt;p&gt;We started collecting and analysing data on job openings published via online job-search websites in the second half of February of 2018. Data collected in the next three months period (including April 2018) allows us to observe some of the main employment trends. We continue collecting and cleaning the data for further and more in-depth analysis; until then, however, we offer a general overview of employment situation in Georgia from February to April, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
